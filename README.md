This repository contains the API sheet cheats for ArrayFire library.

- [API comparison across ArrayFire language wrappers](./api_across_wrappers.md)
- [ArrayFire API equivalents in Matlab and Python (numpy, scipy)](./api_equiv_matlab_python.md)
- [ArrayFire API equivalent in Eigen Library](./api_equiv_eigen.md)

Note:
1. Cross-library API entries may be incorret in few places, we are trying
our best to illustrate the best equivalent API usage in other libraries. If you find any
discrepancies, please raise an issue or you are welcome to raise a PR with correct information.
2. Tne tables are not yet comprehensive and complete. We will keep adding
the information progressively. You are welcome to raise PR with new information for missing
functions.

Initial drafts of the API comparisons where shared by [xichaoqiang](https://github.com/xichaoqiang).
We used those to split them into different documents for readability.
